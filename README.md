# Review-Summarizer

The process of producing summaries from the huge sets of information while maintaining the actual context of information is called Text Summarization. The summary should be fluent and concise throughout.

In this project, we will use many to many sequence models using the Abstractive Text Summarization technique to create models that predict the summary of the reviews. The model will be trained and tested on the first 1,00,000 rows of the dataset file ‘Reviews.csv’. Using the Attention mechanism we will focus on specific keywords while maintaining the context of our sentence.
